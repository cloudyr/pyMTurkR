#' Pay Bonus to Worker
#'
#' Pay a bonus to one or more workers. This function spends money from your
#' MTurk account and will fail if insufficient funds are available.
#'
#' A simple function to grant a bonus to one or more workers. The function is
#' somewhat picky in that it requires a WorkerId, the AssignmentId for an
#' assignment that worker has completed, an amount, and a reason for the bonus,
#' for each bonus to be paid. Optionally, the amount and reason can be
#' specified as single (character string) values, which will be used for each
#' bonus.
#'
#' \code{bonus()}, \code{paybonus()}, and \code{sendbonus()} are aliases.
#'
#' @aliases GrantBonus bonus paybonus sendbonus
#' @param workers A character string containing a WorkerId, or a vector of
#' character strings containing multiple WorkerIds.
#' @param assignments A character string containing an AssignmentId for an
#' assignment performed by that worker, or a vector of character strings
#' containing the AssignmentId for an assignment performed by each of the
#' workers specified in \code{workers}.
#' @param amounts A character string containing an amount (in U.S. Dollars) to
#' bonus the worker(s), or a vector (of length equal to the number of workers)
#' of character strings containing the amount to be paid to each worker.
#' @param reasons A character string containing a reason for bonusing the
#' worker(s), or a vector (of length equal to the number of workers) of
#' character strings containing the reason to bonus each worker. The reason is
#' visible to each worker and is sent via email.
#' @param unique.request.token An optional character string, included only for
#' advanced users. It can be used to prevent resending a bonus. A bonus will
#' not be granted if a bonus was previously granted (within a short time
#' window) using the same \code{unique.request.token}.
#' @param skip.prompt A logical indicating whether to skip the prompt that
#' asks you to continue when duplicate AssignmentIds are found. If TRUE, you will
#' not be asked to confirm. The prompt is a safeguard flag to protect the user from
#' mistakenly paying a bonus twice.
#' @param verbose Optionally print the results of the API request to the
#' standard output. Default is taken from \code{getOption('pyMTurkR.verbose',
#' TRUE)}.
#' @return A data frame containing the WorkerId, AssignmentId, amount, reason,
#' and whether each request to bonus was valid.
