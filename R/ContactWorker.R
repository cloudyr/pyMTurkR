#' Contact Worker(s)
#'
#' Contact one or more workers. This sends an email with specified subject line
#' and body text to one or more workers. This can be used to recontact workers
#' in panel/longitudinal research or to send follow-up work.
#'
#' Send an email to one or more workers, either with a common subject and body
#' text or subject and body customized for each worker.
#'
#' In batch mode (when \code{batch=TRUE}), workers are contacted in batches of
#' 100 with a single identical email. If one email fails (e.g., for one worker)
#' the other emails should be sent successfully. That is to say, the request as
#' a whole will be valid but will return additional information about which
#' workers were not contacted. This information can be found in the MTurkR log
#' file and viewing the XML responses directly.
#'
#' Note: It is only possible to contact workers who have performed work for you
#' previously. When attempting to contact a worker who has not worked for you
#' before, this function will indicate that the request was successful even
#' though the email is not sent. The function will return a value of
#' \dQuote{HardFailure} for \code{Valid} when this occurs. The printed results
#' may therefore appear contradictory because MTurk reports that requests to
#' contact these workers are \code{Valid}, but they are not actually contacted.
#' In batch, this means that a batch will be valid but individual ineligible
#' workers will be reported as not contacted.
#'
#' \code{ContactWorkers()}, \code{contact()}, \code{NotifyWorkers},
#' \code{NotifyWorker()}, and \code{notify()} are aliases.
#'
#' @aliases ContactWorker ContactWorkers contact NotifyWorkers notify NotifyWorker
#' @param subjects A character string containing subject line of an email, or a
#' vector of character strings of of length equal to the number of workers to
#' be contacted containing the subject line of the email for each worker.
#' Maximum of 200 characters.
#' @param msgs A character string containing body text of an email, or a vector
#' of character strings of of length equal to the number of workers to be
#' contacted containing the body text of the email for each worker. Maximum of
#' 4096 characters.
#' @param workers A character string containing a WorkerId, or a vector of
#' character strings containing multiple WorkerIds.
#' @param batch A logical (default is \code{FALSE}), indicating whether workers
#' should be contacted in batches of 100 (the maximum allowed by the API). This
#' significantly reduces the time required to contact workers, but eliminates
#' the ability to send customized messages to each worker.
#' @param verbose Optionally print the results of the API request to the
#' standard output. Default is taken from \code{getOption('pyMTurkR.verbose',
#' TRUE)}.
#' @return A data frame containing the list of workers, subjects, and messages,
#' and whether the request to contact each of them was valid.
